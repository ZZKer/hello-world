github hello world project for beginners

===========

This is the "Hello World" Project presented to new Github users. This project will help me figure out how to use Github.

To start with, I have learned about branching. I am currently using a branch to make edits to the README file while not changing the original. When I finish this edit and am ready to share it, I will push it to the master branch.

The tutorial says to tell about myself. I am ZZKer, random projects person. I work on many small projects, so github is a pretty good place to be. I believe I have another account on here, but I think it's linked to an old school email that I don't use anymore. I am a coder, as well as a hobby musician/artist. I spend time on HabitRPG (which I know uses github) and recently wavepot (which is completely based within github). I hope that setting up this account will help me to better myself within those communities.
